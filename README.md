Jupyter notebook convertor 🔄

A streamlined workflow for converting Jupyter Notebooks into shareable document formats. 🚀 Using Jupyter nbconvert, the notebook illustrates two approaches:

• 📄 Exporting to HTML and then printing to PDF
• 📑 Exporting directly to PDF with LaTeX support

The process highlights the integration of tools such as TeX Live and Pandoc to ensure high‑quality formatting of text, code, and outputs. 🛠️ By combining executable code, narrative explanations, and visualizations 

The outcome is a clear, portable document that can be distributed to colleagues, supervisors, or collaborators without requiring them to run the notebook themselves. 🤝✨
