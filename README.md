# Jupyter-notebook-convertor
Jupyter notebook convertor
a streamlined workflow for converting Jupyter Notebooks into shareable document formats. Using Jupyter nbconvert, the notebook illustrates two approaches:
• 	Exporting to HTML and then printing to PDF.
• 	Exporting directly to PDF with LaTeX support.
The process highlights the integration of tools such as TeX Live and Pandoc to ensure high‑quality formatting of text, code, and outputs. By combining executable code, narrative explanations, and visualizations, the notebook serves as both a reproducible analysis environment and a documentation resource.
The outcome is a clear, portable document that can be distributed to colleagues, supervisors, or collaborators without requiring them to run the notebook themselves.
